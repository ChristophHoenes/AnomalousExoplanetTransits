# AnomalousExoTransit

This anonymized repository contains the source code for the paper "Automatically detecting anomalous exoplanet transits" submitted for review to the "Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences" workshop at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

The anonymized repository only contains the text files with the source code. The datasets will be made available with the camera-ready version of the paper.

Dependencies are summarized in the "requirements.txt" file. They can be installed by running:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

The "main" of each file shows examples of how to execute the code.
