# Automatically detecting anomalous exoplanet transits

This repository contains the source code for the paper "Automatically detecting anomalous exoplanet transits" accepted for the "Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences" workshop at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2021.

The repository contains the source code that was used for the experiments in the paper as well as the datasets.

Dependencies are summarized in the "requirements.txt" file. They can be installed by running:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

The "main" of each file shows examples of how to execute the code.
A description of the datasets as well as more detailed instructions on how to run the code will be added in the future.
